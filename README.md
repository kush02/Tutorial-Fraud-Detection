# Tutorial-Fraud-Detection

In this tutorial, we will learn about how to build a classifier for fraud detection. Fraud detection is important so that people don’t lose money.

I will be using the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. The data was collected and analyzed during a research collaboration between Worldline and the Machine Learning Group of ULB on big data mining and fraud detection.

The tutorial will cover the following tasks:
  1.	Bird’s eye view of the dataset
  2.	Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  3.	Modelling
  4.	Evaluation of different ML algorithms
  5.	Next steps
